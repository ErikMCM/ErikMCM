###### My controversial opinions are...
- JavaScript (or better yet, TypeScript) is the best language for beginners and the best all-around language. Haven't seen a language as flexible and as community driven as it.
- MongoDB is a horrible database for anything with any sort of relational data, but is great for tossing unorganized chaos into like logs. Use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/ "Prisma") with [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/install-cockroachdb "CockroachDB") instead.
- Dell servers and Juniper networking equipment are supreme.
