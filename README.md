###### My controversial opinions are...
- JavaScript (or better yet, TypeScript) is the best language for beginners, and the best all-around language. Haven't seen a language as flexible and as community driven as it.
- MongoDB is a horrible database for anything with any sort of relational data, but is great for tossing unorganized chaos into like logs. Use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/ "Prisma") with [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster "CockroachDB") instead.
- Dell servers and Juniper networking equipment are supreme.
- [Kubuntu 24.04](https://kubuntu.org/ "Kubuntu") > Windows 11. When you're done wasting your life playing video games 24/7, make the switch to Linux.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/ "Bun") is going to become the de facto JavaScript runtime. Adopt it for all of your JavaScript projects, it saves you so much time.

###### My one piece of advice to all developers...
Design like your system is being attacked, all of your other systems have been attacked, and you can't trust anything.
