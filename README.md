I don't have much on this account other than abandoned projects or some small cookie cutter templates and testing playgrounds. Use anything at your will, just follow the license provided.

###### My controversial opinions are...
- JavaScript (or better yet, TypeScript) is the best language for beginners, and the best all-around language. Haven't seen a language as flexible and as community driven as it.
- MongoDB is a horrible database for anything with any sort of relational data, but is great for tossing unorganized chaos into like logs. Use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/ "Prisma") with [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/start-a-local-cluster "CockroachDB") instead.
- Dell servers and Juniper networking equipment are supreme.
- Kubuntu 22.04 > Windows 11. When you're done wasting your life playing video games 24/7, make the switch to Linux.

###### My one piece of advice to all developers...
Design like your system is being attacked, all of your other systems have been attacked, and you can't trust anything.
